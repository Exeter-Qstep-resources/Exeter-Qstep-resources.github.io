# Computational methods
## Python
Below are a series of resources for learning the Python generic programming language. Most of these are tailored towards those who wish to learn the language for data analytics purposes, but many of the skills and methods discussed in these materials are transferable.

#### Introduction to GIS with QGIS

A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to allow researchers to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. This workshop will introduce attendees to the introductory principles of GIS and how to use the Python-based QGIS for research purposes.

#### Presenting and visualising regression results in R

This workshop introduces various ways of automating regression output from Stata and R. It starts by covering ways how to automate table creation for Latex and Word and then proceed to visualising marginal effects and predicted probabilities from linear and binary dependent variable regressions and finally discuss visualisation of interaction effects.

## SPSS

#### Introduction to SPSS

The Q-Step workshop offers a brief guidance on how to get started with SPSS. It reflects on the drawbacks and benefits of the software and explains how to prepare your data to use in SPSS. The workshop then moves on to demonstrate how you can describe the data in SPSS using the 2010 British Election Study data. There are no pre-requisites for taking the workshop, and no prior knowledge of data analysis is assumed.

# Quantiative research methods

## How to read an empirical paper

Reading empirical articles can be intimidating. The new reader may be daunted by technical jargon, complex methodological procedures and statistical analysis. This workshop will guide you through a process to make sense of the typical analysis in an empirical study.

## Writing a quantitative dissertation

These resources are aimed at Q-Step students in their final year of study that are preparing to write a quantitative dissertation. The recorded workshop and the session slides introduce students to the core aspects of writing a "quantitative" dissertation, including several "tips and tricks" regarding research design and the overall dissertation structure.
