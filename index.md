#### Introduction to Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are a fantastic way to learn how to code in Python. They enable instructor to essentially build interactive textbooks. Jupyter is installed as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python. Instructions for downloading and installing this can be found in the following document:

[How to install the Anaconda distribution of Python - pdf file](How_to_install_anaconda.pdf)

The following serves as an introduction to Jupyter notebooks:

**Previous introduction to R workshop**
This workshop provides an introduction to basic programming notions and their application in R. We will start with an overview of R objects and their attributes. You will then learn how to import data into R and perform simple data manipulations. Finally, we will go over a few simple examples of data analysis and visualization and introduce some of the most commonly used R packages. We will be using RStudio, a user-friendly interface to R.

#### Introduction to Bayesian analysis with R - 11/05/2020
One of the advantages of Bayesian analysis is its great flexibility with respect to the functional form of the model. To take full advantage of this flexibility, the analyst need to know how to write code for Stan, JAGS, BUGS or a similar sample.

In this workshop, we will learn the basics of modelling with JAGS (“Just Another Gibbs Sampler”) and R. As an application, we will work through the estimation of simple multi-level models and models with measurement errors.

#### Data visualisation in R

An introduction to the common approaches to data visualisation in R, including line / bar charts, scatterplots, histogram and density plots in base R and using the ggplot2 package. We will also discuss the aesthetics, geoms and faceting systems in ggplot2. Please bring your own laptop with R, RStudio, and the following packages installed: "tidyverse", "titanic".

[Data visualisation in R workshop materials - zip folder](Data_visualisation_in_R.zip)

#### Data management in R

An introduction to some of the most popular functions and packages for data management/manipulation including fast data cleaning, recording a number of variables simultaneously, aggregating or summarising data by groups, merging tables, reshaping tables. Using an example data set provided on the spot, we will go through (s/t)apply functions, and functions provided by the dplyr package and the data.table package.

#### Presenting and visualising regression results in R

This workshop introduces various ways of automating regression output from Stata and R. It starts by covering ways how to automate table creation for Latex and Word and then proceed to visualising marginal effects and predicted probabilities from linear and binary dependent variable regressions and finally discuss visualisation of interaction effects.

#### Social network analysis in R

The workshop provides an introduction for beginners to Social Network Analysis.  It gives an overview of key concepts needed to design research that looks at social relations (networks) that connect individual units (actors), so that students can apply social network analysis to their own research. The workshop focuses on the description and visualisation of social network data, looking at structural properties of a network, as well as ideas of centrality in the network. To understand the SNA perspective, practical examples are given from academic literature, illustrative graphics from the media, and source material visualised through R.

#### Collecting social media data in R

This workshop provides an introduction to the main methods used to access download and store social media data. You will learn how to use Twitter's APIs to collect past and future data, and how to access Facebook data using its Graph API. Basic knowledge of programming in R is required, and participants are encouraged to attend the "Introduction to Programming in R" workshop first.

#### Introduction to SPSS

The Q-Step workshop offers a brief guidance on how to get started with SPSS. It reflects on the drawbacks and benefits of the software and explains how to prepare your data to use in SPSS. The workshop then moves on to demonstrate how you can describe the data in SPSS using the 2010 British Election Study data. There are no pre-requisites for taking the workshop, and no prior knowledge of data analysis is assumed.
